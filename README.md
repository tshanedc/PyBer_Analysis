# PyBer_Analysis

# Overview 
The company V.Isualize tasked me and my colleague Omar to look into how ride-sharing data varies based on city type. Pyber is a Python oriented ride-sharing company, that would greatly benefit from city-by-city analysis of driver, rides, and fares. To give a thorough examination of differences between rural, suburban, and urban areas, it is important to look at the following primary points of analysis: 1. Quantity of rides, drivers, and fares per city type, 2. The average cost of fares per ride by city type. 3. The average cost of fares per driver by city type. Finally, there needs to be an analysis of weekly fares by city type. This will give a better perspective on fare trends over time per type of city.

# Results
As expected most of the rides occurred in the urban areas, followed by the suburban areas, with the fewest occurring in rural areas. Similarly, the majority of drivers were located in urban cities, with the fewest in rural regions. Likewise, the urban areas had the greatest amount of fares in U.S. dollars, while rural towns had the lowest.

This trend is reversed when measuring average fare prices. Because urban areas have larger populations, the average fare price per driver and fare price per ride were the lowest in such population clusters while the prices were highest in rural areas with relatively smaller populations. T

Looking at the weekly trends over time, it is noteworthy that the urban and suburban patterns began with a similar spike in the early weeks of January, while rural areas plummeted. However, both of these city types showed an opposite correlation in the month of April. Also notable is that all city types seemed to spike toward the end of February. Both urban and rural areas exhibited an upward trend in the opening weeks of April.



# Summary
My recommendations to the PyBer CEO are as followed:

(1) Discover what the travel incentive is in the late weeks of April, and why the total fares steadily decrease immediately afterwards.
(2) Target commercial campaigns to increase fare sales in rural areas in the early weeks of January.
(3) Find a way to reallocate drivers from the more urban locations to rural towns. This increase in availability could create an uptick in sales.
